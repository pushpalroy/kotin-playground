 *
 * Flows are cold streams similar to sequences â€” the code inside a flow builder does not run until the flow is collected.
 * This is a key reason the simple function (which returns a flow) is not marked with suspend modifier.
 * The simpleDo() call itself returns quickly and does not wait for anything.
 * The flow starts afresh every time it is collected and that is why we see "Flow started" every time we call collect again.
